# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- Phase 3: zones and runtime configuration.
  - New "Zones" tab: group devices, aggregated with OR-logic presence
    (`GET /api/zones/{id}/state` — occupied if any member currently sees
    motion). Backed by `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/zones[/{id}]`.
  - Each built device now shows live motion/movement-score state, a
    threshold control (`POST /api/devices/{id}/threshold`, backed by HA's
    `number.set_value`), and a "Recalibrate" button (`.../calibrate`,
    backed by `switch.turn_on`) — all read/written through Home
    Assistant's Core API (`homeassistant_api: true`), since ESPectre
    already exposes these as HA entities.
  - `detection_algorithm` (mvs/ml) is a compile-time YAML option, not a
    runtime entity ESPectre exposes — changing it still means a rebuild
    and reflash on the Devices tab, not a Zones-tab control.
  - Best-guess HA entity ids are computed per device from its name and
    are user-editable ("HA entity ids" panel), since the exact id HA
    assigns isn't guaranteed.

## 0.2.0

- Phase 2: device management and browser-based flashing.
  - `POST /api/devices` renders a per-device ESPHome + ESPectre YAML
    (name, Wi-Fi credentials, board, detection algorithm/threshold) from
    a Jinja2 template and validates it with Pydantic.
  - `POST /api/devices/{id}/build` compiles it via the bundled `esphome`
    CLI in a background thread; `GET /api/devices/{id}` polls status/log.
  - `GET /api/devices/{id}/manifest.json` + `.../firmware.bin` expose the
    compiled image as an ESP Web Tools manifest for one-click USB flashing
    from the browser (Web Serial API — needs HTTPS or localhost).
  - `esp-web-tools` is vendored locally (`app/static/vendor/esp-web-tools`,
    Apache-2.0) rather than loaded from a CDN.
  - New "Devices" tab in the Ingress UI for adding, building, and
    flashing devices.

## 0.1.0

- Phase 1: initial add-on skeleton — Ingress-enabled FastAPI backend,
  bundled ESPHome CLI dependency, basic health-check UI.
